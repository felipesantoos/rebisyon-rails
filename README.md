# Ruby on Rails

- Rails is a full-stack framework.
- Render templates.
- Update databases.
- Send and receive e-mails.
- Maintain live pages via WebSockets.
- Enqueue jobs for assincronous work.
- Store uploads in the cloud.
- Provide solid security protections for common attacks.
- Rails is opinionated software.
- Don't Repeat Yourself.
- Convention Over Configuration.
- ruby --version
- sqlite3 --version
- gem install rails
- rails --version
- rails new blog
- rails new --version
- app - Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers, channels, jobs, and assets for your application.
- bin - Contains the rails script that starts your app and can contain other scripts you use to set up, update, deploy, or run your application.
- config - Contains configuration for your application's routes, database, and more.
- config.ru - Rack configuration for Rack-based servers used to start the application.
- db - Contains your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.
- Gemfile & Gemfile.lock - These files allow you to specify what gem dependencies are needed for your Rails application. These files are used by the Bundler gem.
- lib - Extended modules for your application.
- log - Application log files.
- public - Contains static files and compiled assets. When your app is running, this directory will be exposed as-is.
- Rakefile - This file locates and loads tasks that can be run from the command line. The task definitions are defined throughout the components of Rails. Rather than changing Rakefile, you should add your own tasks by adding files to the lib/tasks directory of your application.
- README.md - This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.
- storage - Active Storage files for Disk Service.
- test - Unit tests, fixtures, and other test apparatus.
- tmp - Temporary files (like cache and pid files).
- vendor - A place for all third-party code. In a typical Rails application this includes vendored gems.
- .gitattributes - This file defines metadata for specific paths in a git repository. This metadata can be used by git and other tools to enhance their behavior.
- .gitignore - This file tells git which files (or patterns) it should ignore.
- .ruby-version	- This file contains the default Ruby version.
- bin/rails server
- In the development environment, Rails does not generally require you to restart the server; changes you make in files will be automatically picked up by the server.

```ruby
get "/articles", to "articles#index"
```

- bin/rails generate controller Articles index --skip-routes
- When an action does not explicitly render a view (or otherwise trigger an HTTP response), Rails will automatically render a view that matches the name of the controller and action.
